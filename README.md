# Final_Project_TS3
 Final project on convolutional neural networks of the TS3 course.

The objective of this final project is to design and implement a modulation recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project will involve building a robust CNN model capable of accurately classifying different modulation schemes present in the provided database (RadioML2016). Modulation recognition is a crucial task in wireless communication systems, and your implementation will contribute to the advancement of signal processing in communications.
